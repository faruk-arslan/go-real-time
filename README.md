# Go Real-Time Project

This project is a real-time application built using Go. It demonstrates how to handle real-time  communication using Server-Sent-Events (SSE).

## Prerequisites

- Go installed
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/faruk-arslan/go-real-time
    cd go-real-time
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```No installation needed since it only uses the built-in Go libraries.```

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:
```sh
go run main.go
```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it via `http://localhost:8080/events`. The application will handle real-time communication through SSE.
